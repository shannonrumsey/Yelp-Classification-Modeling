The company, Yelp, provides an amazing platform for business owners and customers alike. When someone uses the website or app, they contribute data that helps open the door to answering many questions. An essential part of the Yelp interface is the business ratings and reviews which enables users to share their experiences or hear from others.

Famous real estate tycoon, Lord Harold Samuel, has been quoted as saying “[t]here are three things that matter in property: location, location, location”. That being said, the hypothesis follows that if location is so important, as Samuel describes, then ratings and reviews should be connected somehow. In practice, our model will take in review and rating information as a means to predict the location of a food-related business, with our sample being enclosed in the Santa Barbara County.
